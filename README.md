# Exercise starting points - Node.js

This repository contains the code / starting points that match the topics in the [material repository](https://github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/material).

- This repo only contains the code / starting points - the exercise _descriptions_ remain in the [material repository](https://github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/material)
- Starting points are in separate branches, the branch name maps to the corresponding topics in the [material repository](https://github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/material), e.g. `logging-fundamentals`
- The code for the starting point resides directly in the top-level directory of the corresponding branch
- The master branch only contains a base project with following run scripts:
    - `npm start` starts the application
    - `npm run watch` starts the application and restarts it when file changes occur
    - `npm test` runs all test
    - `npm lint` runs `eslint`
